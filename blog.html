                <p>
                    The Document Object Model shortly DOM is a programming
                    interface for web documents. It represents the page so that
                    programs can change the document structure, style, and
                    content.The DOM is a model for web pages. It acts as a set
                    of instructions for web browsers.The DOM is an interface
                    that represents how your HTML and XML documents are read by
                    the browser. It allows a language to manipulate, structure,
                    and style your website.

                <h2>How to Select element form dom?</h2>
                <p>We can select dom in many way. Such as</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>getElementById</li>
                    <li>getElementsByClassName</li>
                    <li>getElementsByTagName</li>
                    <li>querySelector</li>
                    <li>querySelectorAll</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But all of them we mostly use getElementById,
                    querySelectorAll.

                <h2>What is bubble event in javascript?</h2>
                <p>
                    Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM it happens when an
                    element receives an event, and that event bubbles up to its
                    parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets
                    to the root element.It is a process that starts with the
                    element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the
                    containing elements in the hierarchy.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2>
                    What is callback function and why it need in javascript?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A callback function is a function passed into another
                    function as an argument or the function is called it's own
                    inside the function.A callback function can run after
                    another function has finished.JavaScript runs code
                    sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some
                    cases that code runs after something else happens and also
                    not sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming.
                    Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run
                    before a task is completed but will run right after the task
                    has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript
                    code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.
