                <p>
                    The Document Object Model shortly DOM is a programming
                    interface for web documents. It represents the page so that
                    programs can change the document structure, style, and
                    content.The DOM is a model for web pages. It acts as a set
                    of instructions for web browsers.The DOM is an interface
                    that represents how your HTML and XML documents are read by
                    the browser. It allows a language to manipulate, structure, and style your website.

                <h2>How to Select element form dom?</h2>
                <p>
                    We can select dom in many way. Such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>getElementById</li>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName</li>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName</li>
                        <li>querySelector</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll</li>
                    </ul>
                    But all of them we mostly use getElementById,
                    querySelectorAll.

                <h2>What is bubble event in javascript?</h2>
                <p>
                    Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM it happens when an
                    element receives an event, and that event bubbles up to its
                    parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets
                    to the root element. Event bubbling is a method of event
                    propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an
                    element inside another element, and both elements have
                    registered a handle to that event. It is a process that
                    starts with the element that triggered the event and then
                    bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.

                <h2>
                    what is callback function and why it need in javascript?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A callback function is a function passed into another
                    function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the
                    outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. A
                    callback function can run after another function has
                    finished.JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down
                    order. However, there are some cases that code runs after
                    something else happens and also not sequentially. This is
                    called asynchronous programming. Callbacks make sure that a
                    function is not going to run before a task is completed but
                    will run right after the task has completed. It helps us
                    develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from
                    problems and errors. In JavaScript, the way to create a
                    callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another
                    function, and then to call it back right after something has
                    happened or some task is completed.
